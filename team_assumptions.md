# Assumptions about our team

* You are good at your job
  * If you weren't you wouldn't be here.
  * I will still question you.
    * When I do question you, it is because:  
      * I'm trying to learn more about what you know and I don't.
      * I'm trying to be a sounding board and make sure you do your best work.
* You have more detailed knowledge than I do of what you are doing.  
  * I have more context than you do. (Context is part of what I do here.)
* You will tell me if you are having trouble doing your job.
  * One of my main responsibilities is setting you up for success, not failure.  
    * You will know before I do if you are not set up for success, so say something.
* You feel safe debating with me.  
  * The best ideas are those that have been viewed from multiple angles and been the subject of debate and discussion.  
    * Sometimes, I will play devil's advocate for this purpose alone.
    * Sometimes, I'm just being dense.
