# Want to talk about an opportunity?  

## Some attributes at a any place I would love working

### Smart coworkers  

_If you are the smartest person in the room, find a new room._

### Impact
I'm here to deliver results.  

I want to make solve problems and build solutions for customers.  

Every organization has interesting problems.  Let's find an important one and solve it.

### Remote first company 

Any company that doesn't know how to run an organization without doing "walk around and see if people look busy" is bad at measuring success.

### High transparency and alignment  

The "Netflix deck" stuff.  Leadership needs to lead by setting the tone and context and allow experts to solve the business problems.  Alignment doesn't work without transparency.

### Tech stack: Agnostic

I have a bias against Ruby because I have only seen it done badly.  It is amazing at quickly creating functionality that will build your company while also creating technical debt that will destroy your company.  Some orgs (Shopify) have a reputation for succeeding with Ruby, but the tool remains dangerous.  I have 15 years of experience in .net and I don't really feel I need more.

#### Java

I used it at GrubHub and it is a tech I'd go back to (I'd actually suggest Kotlin).

#### Clojure

I built a number of microservices in it and would definitely go back to it.

#### Python

I have only used it for trivial scripting work and I would welcome an opportunity to use it to solve real problems.

### Role

#### Senior technologist (staff, architect, team lead, senior at a very flat org)  

This is the best job in tech.  Being hands on coding at least 40% of the time gives one connection with the solutions.  Spending the rest of the time problem solving with stakeholders and aligning developers provides the leverage to solve problems one can't code oneself.  

OR

#### Engineering leadership role (VPE, CTO, Director)

A role with broad influence and responsibility.  Line management is not attractive because it is responsibility without control.
