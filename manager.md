# Hi.  I'm your new manager!

## What is this document?
A way for you to understand why I am here and for us to measure success.  This is heavily inspired by [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/) and others.

## My job

* Find, retain, and encourage really smart developers (that's you).
* Provide context.
* Destroy obstacles.
* Do enough individual contributor work to make me effective at all of the above.

## Our team
[Our team](ourteam.md)

## My assumptions

[My assumptions about you](team_assumptions.md)

## Communications

[How we should communicate](communications.md)

## Structured 1 on 1s

* These are primarily for you your time to talk about whatever you want.
* Secondarily, they are for me to talk about what I want to talk about, but you come first.
* They shouldn't be status updates unless you really want to talk about status updates.
* These are flexible depending on our schedule, but we need to have them.  

## Feedback

* Honest, compassionate feedback is one of the most important tools we have.
* This needs to go both ways.  
  * I'm going to make mistakes.  
    * I expect you to tell me when that happens.
      * Yeah, it might be hard, but I'm counting on you.

## Metrics

* I like to count things.  
  * Story points help us understand our capacity and our velocity.
  * Bug counts tell is if we have a quality problem.
  * Production support tickets tell us where we need to improve the system.
  * Performance metrics ensure our products work the way we need them to.
  * Monitoring ensures we aren't the last to learn about a problem.
* I don't want to be ruled by metrics, but they let us stay on top of the chaos.
* If our metrics ever seem to be driving the wrong behavior, we need to stop and talk about it.  See [Feedback](##Feedback)

## Meetings

* We can always do a 1/1 meeting without a formal agenda
