# Rules for meetings

* We can always to an informal "help me talk through an idea" without a formal agenda.  (although, in reality the agenda is "Let's talk through connection pooling" or whatever.)
* Any meeting over 15 minutes needs to have an agenda.  
  * If I call a meeting > 15 minutes with no agenda, call me out.
  * If possible, we should have a common set of notes for meetings so we know who agreed to what.
  * Meetings produce artifacts: notes or evern screenshots of whiteboards.
* Story grooming is important to get everybody on the same page.
* Retrospectives are important to help us improve.
