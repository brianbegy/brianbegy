# How we should communicate

* Face to face is best.
* Emails - I will reply in < 24 hours.
* Slack - you should expect to get an answer right away.  I will do my best.
* If it ever feels like we are not communicating, grab me and let's hash it out.
* I feel very strongly that teams need to over-communicate their progress.  
  * Transparency builds trust.
  * We should be open and transparent about our successes and our failures.
  * Typically, this takes the form of a weekly status email going to all stakeholders.
