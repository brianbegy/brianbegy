# Hi.  I'm your new team lead!

## What is this document?
A way for you to understand why I am here and for us to measure success.  This is heavily inspired by [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/) and others.

## Feedback

* Honest, compassionate feedback is one of the most important tools we have.
* This needs to go both ways.  
  * I'm going to make mistakes.  
    * I expect you to tell me when that happens.
      * Yeah, it might be hard, but I'm counting on you.

## Metrics

* I like to count things.  
  * Story points help us understand our capacity and our velocity.
  * Bug counts tell is if we have a quality problem.
  * Production support tickets tell us where we need to improve the system.
  * Performance metrics ensure our products work the way we need them to.
  * Monitoring ensures we aren't the last to learn about a problem.
* I don't want to be ruled by metrics, but they let us stay on top of the chaos.
* If our metrics ever seem to be driving the wrong behavior, we need to stop and talk about it.  See [Feedback](##Feedback)
