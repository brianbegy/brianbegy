## This document

A way for you to understand why I am here and for us to measure success.  This is heavily inspired by [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/) and others.

It comes in 2 flavors:

[manager](https://github.com/brianbegy/brianbegy/blob/master/manager.md) and [team lead](https://github.com/brianbegy/brianbegy/blob/master/lead.md) depending on what I'm doing in this job.
