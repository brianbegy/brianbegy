# README

## This document

A way for you to understand why I am here and for us to measure success.  This is heavily inspired by [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-to-rands/) and others.

## My job

* Find, retain, and encourage really smart developers (that's you).
* Provide context.
* Destroy obstacles.
* Do enough indiviudal contributor work to make me effective at all of the above.

## Our team

### My ideal vision of our team is one where

* We are all contributing at a high level.  
  * We deliver features that bring joy to our customers or at least remove sources of pain and frustration.
  * To our stakeholders, we are big damn heroes.
* We take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny.
  * We identify challenges and opportunities and come up with solutions.
  * If something is beyond our control, we look for get it under our control or get help.
* We help each other.
* We hold each other accountable.
* We can expect excellence in ourselves and each other.
* We assume positive intent.
* We always ask "why?" and especially "Why can't we just make it be better?"
* We constantly learn and adapt.
  * If something isn't working, we change it.
* All of this is both fun and sustainable.

## My assumptions

* You are good at your job
  * If you weren't you wouldn't be here.
  * I will still question you.
    * When I do question you, it is because:  
      * I'm trying to learn more about what you know and I don't.
      * I'm trying to be a sounding board and make sure you do your best work.
* You have more detailed knowledge than I do of what you are doing.  
  * I have more context than you do. (Context is part of what I do here.)
* You will tell me if you are having trouble doing your job.
  * One of my main responsibilities is setting you up for success, not failure.  
    * You will know before I do if you are not set up for success, so say something.
* You feel safe debating with me.  
  * The best ideas are those that have been viewed from multiple angles and been the subject of debate and discussion.  
    * Sometimes, I will play devil's advocate for this purpose alone.

## Communications

* Face to face is best.
* Emails - I will reply in < 24 hours.
* Slack - you should expect to get an answer right away.  I will do my best.
* If it ever feels like we are not communicating, grab me and let's hash it out.
* I feel very strongly that teams need to overcommunicate their progress.  
  * Transparency builds trust.
  * We should be open and transparent about our successes and our failures.
  * Typically, this takes the form of a weekly status email going to all stakeholders.  

## Structured 1 on 1s

* These are primarily for you your time to talk about whatever you want.
* Secondarily, they are for me to talk about what I want to talk about, but you come first.
* They shouldn't be status updates unless you really want to talk about status updates.
* These are flexible depending on our schedule, but we need to have them.  

## Feedback

* Honest, compassionate feedback is one of the most important tools we have.
* This needs to go both ways.  
  * I'm going to make mistakes.  
    * I expect you to tell me when that happens.
      * Yeah, it might be hard, but I'm counting on you.
  
## Metrics

* I like to count things.  
  * Story points help us understand our capacity and our velocity.
  * Bug counts tell is if we have a quality problem.
  * Production support tickets tell us where we need to improve the system.
  * Peformance metrics ensure our products work the way we need them to.
  * Monitoring ensures we aren't the last to learn about a problem.
* I don't want to be ruled by metrics, but they let us stay on top of the chaos.
* If our metrics ever seem to be driving the wrong behavior, we need to stop and talk about it.  See [Feedback](Feedback)

## Meetings

* We can always do a 1/1 meeting without a formal agenda
* We can always to an informal "help me talk through an idea" without a formal agenda.  (although, in reality the agenda is "Let's talk through caching" or whatever.)
* Any meeting over 15 minutes needs to have an agenda.  
  * If I call a meeting > 15 minutes with no agenda, call me out.
  * If possible, we should have a common set of notes for meetings so we know who agreed to what.
* Story grooming is important to get everybody on the same page.
* Retrospectives are important to help us improve.
