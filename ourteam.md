# Our team practices

# Core needs
[Adapted from Google's ideas on what teams need](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)
- Psychological safety
    - Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
- Dependability
    - Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
- Structure & clarity
    - Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
- Meaning of work
    - Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
- Impact of work
    - Do we fundamentally believe that the work weâ€™re doing matters?


# Attendance 
## Principles

- In most cases, face to face is best.
- We work a reasonable number of hours.
    - We occasionally work overtime during crunch periods.
    - But we understand that extended overtime...
        - Reduces job satisfaction.
        - Actually reduces productivity.
- We try to work from the office as much as we can.
- Sometimes, working from home is great.
- Our core office hours are 10-4. 
    - Some people like 10-6.
    - Some people like 9-5.
- We respect our team members by being available, being on time, and giving people time to adjust. 
    - We try to give warning when we won't be in.
    - Life happens: people get sick, child care falls through, furnaces give out, so we are flexible.
      - But we need to give our team members warning. 
      - If we will take a day, we give notice as soon as we know.
        - We announce it and put it on the vacation calendar.
    - When one person is remote for a team meeting, everybody is remote for that meeting.
- When we do get sick...
    - We take care of ourselves by resting when we cannot or should not work.
    - We take care of our team by working from home when we are contagious.
- Nobody [goes dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/) for an extended period.


# Practices
## Standup

- We show respect for our team by being on time, especially for stand.
- We talk about what we have been doing since our last stand.
- We talk about what we plan to do before our next stand.
- We talk about blocking issues.
- We talk about discovered tasks or complications.
- We review our collective situation.
  - Do we have open PRs that need review?
  - Are we likely to exceed or miss sprint commitments?
    - Do we need to communicate to our stakeholders? 
    - Do we need to find additional work?
- We talk about any issues of common interest.
    - e.g. "Remember, I'm off all next week so if you need me, get me before 3."

## PRs
- Code reviewing should be considered a high-priority task.
