# Our team practices

# Core needs
[Adapted from Google's ideas on what teams need](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)
- Psychological safety
    - Can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?
- Dependability
    - Can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?
- Structure & clarity
    - Are goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?
- Meaning of work
    - Are we working on something that is personally important for each of us?
- Impact of work
    - Do we fundamentally believe that the work weâ€™re doing matters?

# Vision

* We are all contributing at a high level.  
  * We deliver features that bring joy to our customers or at least remove sources of pain and frustration.
  * To our stakeholders, we are big damn heroes.
* We take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny.
  * We identify challenges and opportunities and come up with solutions.
  * If something is beyond our control, we look for ways to get it under our control or get help.
* We help each other.
* We hold each other accountable.
* We can expect excellence in ourselves and each other.
* We assume positive intent.
* We always ask "why?" and especially "Why can't we just make it be better?"
* We constantly learn and adapt.
  * If something isn't working, we change it.
* All of this is both fun and sustainable.

# Attendance 
## Principles

- We work a reasonable number of hours.
    - We occasionally work overtime during crunch periods.
    - But we understand that extended overtime...
        - Makes us unhappy.
        - Actually reduces productivity.
- We respect our team members by being available, being on time, and giving people time to adjust. 
    - We try to give warning when we won't be in.
    - Life happens: people get sick, child care falls through, furnaces give out, so we are flexible.
      - But we need to give our team members warning. 
      - If we will take a day, we give notice as soon as we know.
        - We announce it and put it on the vacation calendar.
    - When one person is remote for a team meeting, everybody is remote for that meeting.
- When we do get sick...
    - We take care of ourselves by resting when we cannot or should not work.
    - We take care of our team by working from home when we are contagious.
- Nobody [goes dark](https://blog.codinghorror.com/dont-go-dark/) for an extended period.


# Practices
## Code
- We work in the open.
    - Everybody tries to write code and commit code every day.
      - Delivery is a muscle.  We exercise it.
    - Most people have a PR most days.
 - Everybody reviews code.
    - Your input is valuable.
    - Do not hesitate to review code written by more experienced people.
  
## Testing
- We own the quality of our code.
    - We test our own work *before* anyone else can find our mistakes.
    - We think about testabliilty as a first-class concern.
    - We test 100% of the code we think needs testing.  
    - We test 0% of the code we don't think needs testing.
    - We can depend on our tests.

## Standup

- We talk about what we have been doing since our last stand.
- We talk about what we plan to do before our next stand.
- We talk about blocking issues.
- We talk about discovered tasks or complications.
- We review our collective situation.
  - Do we have open PRs that need review?
  - Are we likely to exceed or miss sprint commitments?
    - Do we need to communicate to our stakeholders? 
    - Do we need to find additional work?
- We talk about any issues of common interest.
    - e.g. "Remember, I'm off all next week so if you need me, get me before 3."
